├── README.md: This lab on basic NLP preprocessing was an illuminating experience that deepened my understanding of what truly makes natural language processing "intelligent." Before diving in, preprocessing felt like a mere preliminary step—a necessary chore before the real work began. However, this module emphatically drove home its pivotal role in shaping the effectiveness, efficiency, and even the interpretability of any downstream NLP task.
