Deep Learning Applied AI Portfolio

Welcome to my Deep Learning Applied AI Portfolio, created as part of the Applied AI & Robotics program. This portfolio showcases the essential skills, hands-on projects, and technical competencies I developed throughout the course. It reflects my ability to design, train, evaluate, and deploy deep learning models that solve real-world problems using modern AI technologies.

Deep Learning is a transformative field powering innovations in computer vision, natural language processing, robotics, recommendation systems, and autonomous decision-making. Through this portfolio, I demonstrate my mastery of neural network fundamentals, practical implementation techniques, and best practices for building AI systems responsibly and efficiently.
